### Purpose and Scope of the Project

For this project I decided to take data from the U.S Energy Information Administration and create Choropleth maps with them. The two variables I decided to explore was the Total Energy Consumed by State and the Most Consumed Energy Source by State. Then for each variable, I made both a static and interactive version. I did this because I thought it would be valuable to understand where different places draw their energy from and how enegery they draw. This information could be useful in future endeavors to modify our power grid, such as deciding which places need or understanding which places would be the best candidates for alternative energy sources.

The graph above is a choropleth of the 48 states of the Continental US showing the total energy consumption of each state in 2022. Some insights that can be gained from this graph are that most of the states in the Rocky Mountains and the Great Plains consumed far less energy in 2022 than states in the Midwest. Additionally, California and Texas seems to be outlines in their region, consuming far more energy than their neighboring states.

    alt = "The graph above is a choropleth of the 48 states of the Continental US. With each state colored by which energy source they consumed the most of in 2022. There are three possible colors, Cyan which represent Imported Electricity being the most consumed, Orange which represents Natural Gas being the most consumed, and finally Purple which represents Petroleum products being the most consumed. The main trend found in this choropleth is that the states in the Rocky Mountains, the Midwest, and the Mid-Atlantic for the most part relied on Natural Gas for their energy needs. Meanwhile the sates in the South and the Southwest the most part relied on Imported Electricity. Finally, it should be noted that the majority of states in New England mainly relied on Petroleum products for their energy needs."

The graph above is a choropleth of the 48 states of the Continental US showing the most consumed energy source of each state in 2022. Some insights that can be gained from this graph are that most states in the Rocky Mountains, the Midwest, and the Mid-Atlantic consumed more Natural Gas than any other energy source. We also see that most states in the South and Southwest consumed more Imported Electricity than any other energy source. It should also be noted that the very few states that consumed more Petroleum products than any other energy source can all be found in New England.
