Welcome to my site, I'm Mario! I'm currently an aspiring Software Developer studying Mathematics and Computer Science at [St. Olaf College](https://wp.stolaf.edu/). I am a fast learner and love tackling complex problems of any type. In my of time you will often find me enjoying a nice board game with friends or in a good book.
